/* * REVISED and entitled: emgfwsbot
 * Code: 6522 
 * April 3, 2013
 * Tank Review 
 * Section 1 
 * Professor Greg Anderson
 * 
 * *******************************************************************
 * STRENGTHS:
 * Wave Surfing - detects a drop in the enemy's energy to create a wave which enables the bot to statistically keep away from danger zones
 * or areas where the bot thinks the bullet from the enemy may be. Especially useful for keeping away from bullets one on one with the enemy
 * however, this does require a lot of energy and (math). This really highlights areas and the likliehood that the enemy fired at a specific area. 
 * Precise Prediction - calculates areas of the wave that are safest AND that the bot could reach, tries to move to the safest of each wave 
 * this is why the bot has a sort of back and forth motion sometimes and acts like SmoothHugger does sometimes. 
 * 
 * *************
 * CHANGES I made: 
 * Movement is not wave surfing when just running when it scans a robot it acts like a wave surfer. 
 * Added a gun called the melee gun or shadow gun - does really really really well against all the robots (sample ones) 
 * Doesn't survive like Walls - was only 1st one time out of ten in a ten rounds match... 
 * 
 * WHY? 
 * The Gun works only with the movement pattern in the run() method. Also the movement pattern associated with the gun 
 * helps the gun to work better in melee, then on a scanned bot - Which is most of the time with wave surfing it implements 
 * the wave surfing technique.
 * 
 * WEAKNESSES and a log of attempts to strengthen them: 
 * *******************************************************************
 * Rams into bots without moving its gun to shoot them because its locked onto the bots
 * Gun is very very basic - it locks onto targets even when those targets are at a far distance and the bullets can't reach the target
 * Runs out of energy quickly because of its wave surfing movement to avoid bullets 
 * With a lot of bots at first the bot doesn't know what to do and gets stuck in the crossfire 
 * Targets bots and sticks with them when they are over a long span of distance and the 
 * bullets it fires are way off target because of the distance
 * Never survives - always the loser - comes in third against the sample bots and some nano melee bots 
 * 
 * Wave Surfing Weaknesses - does not keep its distance from the enemy, this makes predicting where the bullet will land in a 
 * particular wave, it DOES NOT help in keeping away from the enemy 
 * 
 * Enemy Energy Tracking - the Enemy Wave Detection is not that great. It could be a lot better if there was more keeping 
 * track of energy losses from hitting walls, firing bullets, etc. 
 * 
 * Segmentation - this is necessary because this bot currently really only avoids head-on targeting
 * 
 * No data or anything onBulletHitBullet - there is no information being gathered here and it could be useful 
 * 
 * Choice of Wave - right now the bot chooses the wave that is closest - but doesn't take into calculation the wave that contains the bullet
 * that will hit it first
 * 
 * 
 * *****************
 * CHANGES I made - gun taken from Broken Sword from Voidious to understand more of the basics about shooting and targeting
 * Changed the rectField - so that it wasn't hard coded in. It will get the height and width from the field from robocode and work within that context 
 * Added a melee gun - it works really well against lots of robots 
 * changed the firepower when there is only one other bot on the field to save energy and power when one on one 
 * 
 * New weakness! 
 * Is not always first. Survival is significantly behind walls, even though it comes in first above walls in firepower. 
 * *******************************************************************
 * Changes to be made in the future: 
 * Add a gun which is integrated into the bots wave surfing movement like Komarious. Integrate the movement, radar, and gun. 
 * Detect where the enemy bot is and keep a certain distance away. 
 * 
 * This bot is really effective in its firing - but, its really bad at survival. In the future I would like to change the number of times it fires when there is 
 * only one bot left - I would do this by firing a spread of bullets at a very low fire power. Because this bot is good at avoiding bullets I think this would
 * be the most logical solution to surviving = energy conversion. 
 * 
 * *******************************************************************
 * Movement taken from Basic Wave Surfing Tutorial: http://robowiki.net/wiki/Wave_Surfing_Tutorial by Voidious
 * Gun and targeting  based on HawkOnFire by rozu. *Modified April 3 - based off of Broken Sword by Voidious
 * Che moves by predicting enemies’ bullet path and “surfing” to the outside of this *projected path.
 *
 * Targeting and Firing: *modified April 3 to Broken Sword Gun and some of its movement by Voidious (followed copyright (see copyright below))
 * Melee/Shadow Gun - GuessFactorTargeting through a radar lock 
 * selects a target through deciding an a target with low energy and then also closest targets (a combination of those two)
 * Builds off of HawkOnFire
 * 
 * Movement: Creates waves based on a drop in energy from enemy robots, 
 * then uses predictive positioning to move to the safest area within the wave
 * in the run method - utilizes a minimumriskmovement 
 * in the onscannedrobot event - utilizes wave surfing
